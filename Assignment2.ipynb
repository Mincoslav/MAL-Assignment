    "# review1 = \"There were two interesting look back reviews that came out in 2015 that are worth checking out - just search for <<review terminator sarah connor chronicles>> and check out the retrospectives in The Guardian and on IGN. The IGN retrospective is especially valuable due to the inclusion of video cast interviews that don't show up on YouTube - there are a lot of insights as to how the principle actors viewed their characters and where they hoped the plot and reveals would go. Ultimately the writer Josh Friedman did give us fans what we wanted, just not in the definitive manner the actors hoped for their characters. I think it is better that way - showing us and let us draw our own conclusions, instead of laying it out in black and white. But, yeah, for you Jameron shippers, you were right, the seeds were there all along and the final episode is a real heartbreaker.\"\n",
    "review1 = \"One of the best stand alone TV Sci-Fi shows ever, joining Firefly on the list of <<why ever did they cancel that >>? Perhaps the best answer is that it is a miracle it was made in the first place, given that cancer survivor Josh Friedman produced a death obsessed, stylish, inventive and often very funny TV show with more depth and sophistication than the dying film franchise. A Hollywood insider needs to write the real back story to this show: how it suited Warner Brothers to have what was, in effect, an extended commercial on TV for the upcoming reboot of the movie franchise, what transpired between Warner and Fox, and why Fox started to pull the plug on the cash. There are episodes in season two that were clearly made with everyone concerned expecting to be fired by the end of the day. The production values dropped as the budget dried up, but the excellent acting, production and cinematography did not.

    "**a)** Learn different neural network models by varying the network architecture (i.e. number of layers and neurons in each layer) and the type of network (i.e. fully connected vs. convolutional). For each configuration, determine the time it takes to learn the model, and the accuracy on the test data. *Caution*: for some configurations, learning here can take a little while (several minutes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Inspect some misclassified cases. Do they correspond to hard to recognize digits (also for the human reader)? (Hint: you can e.g. use the numpy where() function to extract the indices of the test cases that were misclassified: `misclass = np.where(test != predictions)` )\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** How do results (time and accuracy) change, depending on whether you consider an 'easy' binary task (e.g., distinguishing '1' and '0'), or a more difficult one (e.g., '4' vs. '5'). \n",
    "\n",
    "**d)** Identify one or several good configurations that give a reasonable combination of accuracy and runtime. Use these configurations to perform a full classification of the 10 classes in the original dataset (after split into train/test). Using `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` you can get an overview of all combinations of true and predicted labels (see p. 298-299 in Müller & Guido). What does this tell you about which digits are easy, and which ones are difficult to recognize, and which ones are most easily confused?"
