For each configuration, determine the time it takes to learn the model, and the accuracy on the test data. *Caution*: for some configurations, learning here can take a little while (several minutes).\n",

    "**d)** Identify one or several good configurations that give a reasonable combination of accuracy and runtime. Use these configurations to perform a full classification of the 10 classes in the original dataset (after split into train/test). Using `sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix` you can get an overview of all combinations of true and predicted labels (see p. 298-299 in Müller & Guido). What does this tell you about which digits are easy, and which ones are difficult to recognize, and which ones are most easily confused?"
